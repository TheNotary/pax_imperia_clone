Only invest in code time that is directly visible unless it resolves the Limit Tech Debt rule.  The next thing that should be done is something that can be demonstrated on the visual display.  

###### Limit Tech Debt

Make sure the code isn't confusing anywhere.  

- It can be in a "non-final" state as long as it is trivial to refactor into the final state and it already exists in the non-final state and it isn't confusing.
